        <p>
            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 
            <mark>eleven players</mark> on a field at the centre of which is a 
            <pre>22-yard pitch</pre> with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on 
            <code>three stumps</code>. The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat, while the 
            <abbr title="Bowling and Fielding">bowling and fielding</abbr> side tries to prevent this and 
            <blockquote>dismiss</blockquote> each batter.
